I'm inheriting a home when my father starts a trust I want to buy a second home. And get a jumbo loan and pay it off with a market bond. My family lived on Maryland Ave in a large home 
before my moms heart attack in 1986, we moved to Redstone Condos. she lived until 1996. After getting diabeties when she was three years old. After eating alot of sugar at a young age. My step mom died of cancer she was a Sexton. She was adopted from the Tates. My mom and father and a morgage on a large home in Bristol TN in 1984 before her heart attack. My father and step mother bought the families childhood home that my grandfather rented in 1960 in 2000. I went to Sullins Acedemy boarding school. Skipped the first grade, Graduated Catholic School, Graduated High School, Graduated Prep School and have 98 bachelor of science credits in Computer Science at UVa Wise. I'm Windows Server 2003 and Windows 7 Internals Certified. I'm a Silverlight Partner and A Microsoft Design Partner from 2011-2014. And I'm applying for a Windows 8/8.1 Copyright I was awarded a Flash patent by Macromedia in 2003. I was unaware of Sony Extra Sensory Perception in 2001 and was dianognosed with schizoaffective disorder. I thought a NBC broadcaster was talking to me when it was realy Sony ESP. I have a normal MRI. I have old heritage. I have $400K in Macromedia working capital from the Adobe and Macrromedia Merger for salaries. Own shares of a income fund small initial investment in 2003. Thousands of shares are pooled into the fund. I have picture framed Gates and Ballmer email. One of which Ballmer called Linux a cancer. In my Soho I'm running Windows Server 2012 R2 with VLC ESU's, Trying Configuration Manager. I own a patent worth $8 million from Macromedia Flash which was rebranded to Amimate which is good for loans and amortilization. My family consists of Robert Hathaway, Curtis Hathaway, Patricia McCauley, Debbie Bright, Anne Turner from New York City, Rebecca McGiunness from Califorinia, Patrica Shubert Robison that gratuated Standord in 1939 in creative writing. Through Familiy TreeDNA's X match's

For instance, assume a patent’s complete price is $52,000. Debit $52,000 to the patent account. Credit the identical quantity to the money account in the identical journal entry. A credit decreases money, which can also be an asset on the balance sheet. Subtract the residual worth you expect the patent to attain by the end of its useful life from its price

Collateral is an asset pledged by a borrower to a lender until a loan is paid back. If the borrower defaults, then the lender has the right to seize the collateral and sell it to pay off the loan

How to Build MS-DOS and Windows
				
<p><a target="_self" href="https://computerhistory.org/blog/microsoft-ms-dos-early-source-code/" data-test-app-aware-link="">MS-DOS Source</a></p>
<p>MS-DOS 1.25 was published on GitHub MS-DOS 1.25 was completely written in 8086 assembly so it needs to be assembled using an assembler (MASM and SCP 8086 Assembler). The object file(s) produced by MASM will then be linked to produce an executable which will then be converted to a raw binary executable (.COM). The .HEX files produced by SCP 8086 Assembler will be converted directly to raw .COM files using the HEX2BIN utility.</p>
<p>2. How to Make DOS?</p>

<p>This is as hard as the source code for the DOS BIOS (IO.SYS) was designed for Virtual Box and is not PC-compatible. Theoretically, the compiled binaries should work on Virtual Box but using the source code release by Microsoft alone will not produce a valid bootable disk as no source code for the boot sector is given. I do have access to the source code of the boot sector but as a result of Microsoft not releasing it publicly, I will not share it. This basically means with only the source code published by Microsoft, it is impossible to produce a working copy of MS-DOS 1.25.</p>
<p>3. What is Required</p>

<p>The following is required for compiling MS-DOS 1.25:</p>
<ul>
   <li> Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM)</li>
   <li> Microsoft 8086 Object Linker (LINK)</li>
   <li> EXE to Binary Conversion Utility (EXE2BIN)</li>
   <li> Seattle Computer Products 8086 Assembler (ASM)</li>
   <li> HEX to Binary Conversion Utility (HEX2BIN)</li>
   <li> A copy of the MS-DOS 1.25 source code</li>
</ul>
<p>4. Details</p>

<p>The files STDDOS.ASM and MSDOS.ASM can be assembled to produce the DOS kernel and they are MASM compatible. All switches are set in the file STDDOS.ASM. MSVER generates binaries for MS-DOS with Microsoft copyright strings, IBM produces IBM PC-DOS binaries with IBM copyright strings. There is no need to change HIMEM and DSKTEST unless you want to experiment more with it.</p>

<p>COMMAND.ASM can be assembled using MASM to produce the command interpreter for MS-DOS. Just like the DOS kernel, you may use switches to produce both MS-DOS and IBM PC-DOS binaries. The HIMEM switch is also present.</p>

<p>ASM.ASM, HEX2BIN.ASM, IO.ASM and TRANS.ASM were written by SCP and must be assembled using their own assembler. IO.ASM have switches to configure the floppy disk controller and the Cromemco 4FDC is currently supported by The SIMH Altair 8800 Z80 simulator.</p>
<p>5. Compile It</p>

<p>Now, we are ready to compile MS-DOS 1.25 for the first time! If you are experienced in assembly, used those assemblers and tools listed above, then you should be able to get everything done by yourself. For those unable to assemble it on their own, my build disk will save your time.</p>

<p>Here is how to build MS-DOS 1.25 with the build disk: Download the build disk. create a new virtual machine using your favorite emulator or hypervisor. Add a floppy drive, load the build disk. Start the virtual machine (it should boot from the build disk). Check the filenames using the DIR command and it should return: Type in MK <FILENAME> to assemble that particular component or MK ALL to assemble everything. Once you have everything assembled, type in DIR *.COM and DIR *.SYS to see the executable produced, it should be similar to: You have done it! You can now copy those executables to another disk or extract them or run them!</p>

<h3 > Whistler and pre-reset Longhorn </h3>
<p > The top-most branch was called <strong>main</strong>, which integrated changes from all labs. Under it were several numbered labs, each of which was working on a separate part of Windows, such as:</p>
</ul>
<p > These labs also had a "_N" branch, which served as a buffer between main and the actual branch. For example, changes from the main branch would first get integrated into Lab06_N before later being   integrated into Lab06 in a process called forward integration. The same   applied for reverse integration, where the lab would first integrate   changes into its N-branch before integrating them into the main branch.</p>
<p > There were also <strong>idx</strong> (internal development workstation/server) branches, builds from which are usually recompilations intended for TAP/OEM partners. However, they were also   occasionally released for public testing, e.g. <a target="_self" href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/Windows_Longhorn_build_4074" data-test-app-aware-link="">Windows Longhorn build 4074</a> or <a target="_self" href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/Windows_XP_build_2257" data-test-app-aware-link="">Windows XP build 2257</a>. </p>
<p > Before the release of <a target="_self" href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/Windows_XP" data-test-app-aware-link="">Windows XP</a>, the main branch was forked into the <strong>xpclient</strong> branch while the main branch moved on to track <a target="_self" href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/Windows_Server_2003" data-test-app-aware-link="">Windows Server 2003</a> development.After the final version was shipped, new branches were created for   updates, hotfixes and Service Pack development. Similarly, the <strong>dnsrv</strong> branch   (short for Dot NET Server, i.e. Windows .NET Server) was forked from   the main branch before the release of Windows Server 2003. </p>
<h3 > Since Longhorn reset </h3>
<p > The lab hierarchy was overhauled after the development reset of <a target="_self" href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/Windows_Vista" data-test-app-aware-link="">Longhorn</a> to   address the flaws that plagued most of the pre-reset period. Instead of  having a small amount of general virtual build labs each focusing on a  different general scope of Windows functionality, a new hierarchical   model with considerably more feature branches was introduced, which   helped reduce the amount of code to reverse integrate for branch.   Microsoft also set stricter criteria for reverse integrating changes   from the labs into the main branch, which was now renamed to <strong>winmain</strong>. </p>
<p > The main branch was later renamed to <strong>rsmain</strong> at some point after the release of <a target="_self" href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/Windows_10" data-test-app-aware-link="">Windows 10</a>, and then to <strong>rsmaster</strong> after   the Windows source repository's conversion to Git, likely to comply with the Git convention of calling the top-most branch the master   branch. At some point after February 2021,
<a target="_self" href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/Build_lab#cite_note-5" data-test-app-aware-link="">[2]</a> the branch was renamed back to <strong>main</strong>. This was likely done in order to follow suit with other Microsoft   projects after the master/slave terminology became a subject of controversy in 2020 due to slavery connotations.
<a target="_self" href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/Build_lab#cite_note-6" data-test-app-aware-link="">[3]</a>
<a target="_self" href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/Build_lab#cite_note-7" data-test-app-aware-link="">[4]</a></p>

<p> Historically, the build lab was a physical room populated with machines that periodically produced mainline builds of <a target="_self" href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/Windows_NT" data-test-app-aware-link="">Windows NT</a>. At first, there was a single build lab for the entire project that all   developers submitted their changes to. As the number of developers grew, the concept of virtual build labs was introduced, where each team   developing a subset of the feature set works on its own separate branch   and has one or more machines compiling periodic builds of that branch. Each developer submits their changes first to their team's branch, and   they are merged to the mainline only after they meet its acceptance criteria. Other teams can then pull the changes from the mainline into their branches. </p>
<p> Builds that were not built by the build lab machines, but are rather compiled by individual Microsoft employees, are called private builds. They are identified by having the VS_FF_PRIVATEBUILD file flag set in the executable's version information and by including the account name of the individual or service that initiated the build in the   branch part of the build tag. </p>
<p> Microsoft has used several branching systems since the start of <a target="_self" href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/Windows_XP" data-test-app-aware-link="">Windows XP</a> development, which differ in the hierarchy of labs as well as in the naming scheme. However, there are some specifics common to most schemes, such as the presence of a top-most main branch, or the use of special branches for important development milestones. </p>

<pre>path %path%;D:\NT\tools\perl\bin;D:\binaries.x86fre;D:\NT\tools\sp;D:\NT\tools\x86</pre>
<pre>set sdxroot=D:\NT</pre>
<pre>enlist projects ex: sdx enlist NT master com -c 
tools\ntnewver.cmd</pre>
<pre>\\PATSTYLESVS.main.x86.fre</pre>
<pre>\\%COMPUTERNAME%.main.x86.fre in BuildMachine.txt</pre>    
<p>We look in BuildMachines.txt for the machine name, branch, architecture,and build type. If we find a match, then we set OFFICIAL_BUILD_MACHINE
  to the appropriate value ("primary" or "secondary") look for the the offical build machine client in sdktools->debuggers->vs->enlistment->sd.ini.txt.
</p>
<pre>tools\verifybuildmachine.cmd</pre>
<pre>perl xcopy2binplace.pl</pre>
<p>You can compile the Lab 01 down to about 8 errors the rest of the Labs and Operating System shouldn't have any errors. You should have the research kernel to muck around with also from college, needing to comment out the Longhorn additions in revision 6000, files beginning with 'dp' are Longhorn files. The 'dp' files are not in the 'Longhorn' beta LDK they maybe in a IDW or internal developer workstation release if I can find one. Maybe look in Embedded 2009 for supported hardware and maybe learning what PCI hardware and coding the plug n' play to support in the NT Kernel. The PCI codes you can use now a days in 2024 is Linux and you might want to remove some of the cheap hardware.</p>

<strong>Lab01</strong>: Kernel
<pre>Copy the base\ntos directory and all of it's files to Lab01 it might be a virtual lab in source depot and it is a physical lab.</pre>
<pre>CD to base\busdrv\isapnp and use the message compiler to generate 'message.h'</pre>
<pre>Make pcicodes.h using the message compiler too. This file goes in base\busdrv\pci</pre>
<pre>build -cz </pre> 
<pre>delobj.cmd to clean the source tree</pre>	

<strong>Lab02</strong>: Networking
	<pre>Copy the NT\net directory to Lab02. The Network Stack or Lab will build without error in the Vitrual Lab. 
     You might have issues in the Pysical Lab</pre>		
	<pre>build -cz</pre>
	<pre>delobj.cmd to clean the source tree</pre>	
<strong>Lab03</strong>: Server<a target="_self" href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/Build_lab#cite_note-3" data-test-app-aware-link="">[c]</a>
	<pre>Copy the Entire Server folder from nt5src.7z to Lab03</pre>
	<pre>The entire Server build should build with about 20 shipping errors and take about 6 hrs for a free build and 12 hrs for a checked.</pre>
	<pre>build -cz</pre>
	<pre>delobj.cmd to clean the source tree</pre>
<strong>Lab04</strong>: Terminal Services<a target="_self" href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/Build_lab#cite_note-4" data-test-app-aware-link="">[1]</a>
	<pre>Copy NT\termsrv directory to Lab04. The Terminal Services Stack should build without error in the Virtual Lab.
		You might have issues in the Physical Lab.
	</pre>
	<pre>build -cz</pre>
	<pre>delobj.cmd to clean the source tree</pre>

<strong>Lab05</strong>: Shared Source Common Language infustructure
<pre>However the Beta Wiki doesn't list a Lab 05 I believe it's either the SSCLI or the COM Stack. 
With the .NET Framework. To build the SSCLI you need Visual Studio 2005 Professional or higher 
in a 2000 or 2003 Virtual Machine. And Active State Perl ActivePerl-5.16.3.1603-MSWin32-x86-296746.msi
 or ActivePerl-5.16.3.1603-MSWin32-x64-296746.msi for 64-Bit extract the sscli20_20060311.tgz for 2.0 
or 1.0 sscli_20021101.tgz sscli_ref_20021101.tgz and and Gyro Genetrics with 1.0 and execute env.bat 
at the root of the directory. To set the free or checked environment then execute buildall.cmd. 
To build the COM stack run build -cz 
in the root of the COM directory or lab.</pre>
<strong>Lab06</strong>: User interface
<pre>Copy NT\shell directory to Lab06. The UI Stack should build without error in the Virtual Lab.
	 You might have issues in the Physical Lab. With the GNUmakfile
</pre>
<pre>build -cz</pre>
<pre>delobj.cmd to clean the source tree</pre>

<strong>Lab07</strong>: Internet Information Services/COM+ 
<pre>Copy NT\inetsrv directory to Lab07. The IIS Stack should build without error in the Virtual Lab.
		You might have issues in the Physical Lab.
	</pre>
	<pre>build -cz</pre>
	<pre>delobj.cmd to clean the source tree</pre>
<p > build individual projects </p>
<pre>in the directory of a makefile with build -cz</pre>
<p > or </p>
<p > build the whole operating system </p>
<pre>perl tools\timebuild.pl -NOCLEANBUILD -NOSYNC -NOSCORCH </pre>
If you want to wait 6 to 12 hours for a new clean build you'll type this:
<pre>perl tools\timebuild.pl -!NOCLEANBUILD -NOSYNC -NOSCORCH  -NOPOSTBUILD</pre>
<pre>build -cz</pre>
<p>make a 'symbol' share with symbol and build subdirectories.</p>
<pre>symsrv.cmd</pre>
<p > POSTBUILD: </p>
<p > We only create boot floppy images on fre compressed i386 builds. </p>
<pre>tools\postbuildscripts\sanitycheckunicodefiles.cmd</pre>
<p> Generate the winnt32.msi for different SKUs </p>
<pre>tools\postbuildscripts\winnt32msi.cmd</pre>
<pre>tools\postbuildscripts\makebuildname.cmd</pre>
<pre>tools\postbuildscripts\cdimage.cmd -d Release</pre>
<pre>move delobj.cmd the the tools directory to the NT Root and clean the source tree by deleting all the object files. After the build</pre>
<p >Close Razzle Window run the VC7 vcvars32.bat from the VCBuilt share and set _NTTREE environment variable. Which is the binaries directory.</p>
<pre>path %path%;D:\binaries.x86fre\bldtools</pre>
<p >Copy the 'copyddkfiles.cmd' the the NT\base\ddk directory for the tools directory run: </p>
<pre>copyddkfiles.cmd ddk_base.ini ddk D:\NT\base</pre>
<p >It should begin to copy the ddk files you will need to edit the ddk, hal, IFS INI files to fit your kit needs. </p>
<p>You might want to learn how to make a service pack.</p>
<pre>cd to D:\NT\tools\postbuildscripts\svcpack\ and open spcab.cmd and set the FILELIST CABNAME and EVENTNAME using the gold directory
text files as a FILENAME</pre>
<p >After the build run the post build batch file in the tools directory and read the error log you shouldn't get any errors in Windows XP/2003 Professional Edition. </p>
<pre>certmgr.msc, go to Trusted Root Certification Authorities\Certificates and remove the Microsoft Test Root Authority certificate,
Sign out and Sign in again. The 'For Testing Purposes' Watermark should now be removed.</pre>
<p>It takes 6 hours to build a Free Build and 12 hrs a Checked.</p>
<p>Themes</p>
<pre>To test the defualt Visual Styles build and execute UXBUD.EXE in the shell->themes directory</pre>
<p>Build packthem, cd to the themedir and build 'mallard' read the Powerpoints use Office XP, And Adobe CS2.</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/winxp-mallard">Here's is a Mallard Screenshot</a></p>
<p>After the build the Active Directory Migration Tools and Debugging Tools should be built. After the post build very edition and every supported language should be built. In the binaries directory the usa   default build should be revision 6000 leading up to Windows Embedded 2009. After the Windows 6000 revision source build you might want to use the SLD files in the 'mantis' folder with XP embedded and make a Embedded Windows repository and engineer 2003 revision 6000 which was released in Embedded 2009. You can compile the Operating System down to about 16 errors needing to remove the Longhorn additions in revision 6000 maybe look in Embedded 2009 for supported hardware and maybe learning what PCI hardware and coding the plug n' play to support in the NT Kernel. The PCI codes you can use now a days in 2024 is Linux and you might want to remove some of the cheap hardware.</p>

<p>The Boot Process for XP/2003 is:</p>
<p>Use Bootsect to write MBR and boot sector.</p>
<pre>bootsect /nt52. e:</pre>
<p>NTLDR, Ntdetect.com, Ntbootdd.sys, Ntoskrnl.exe, hal.dll, smss.exe, winlogon.exe, Service Contol Manager SCM</p>
<p>In a free build the kernel may not build you may have to to use the Windows Research Kernel. Microsoft does not give you the source to WinLogon even in the SSLIP. It's named Winlogon.exe.lc</p>
<p>A <strong>build lab</strong> (or simply a <strong>lab</strong>) commonly refers to a <a target="_self" href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/Microsoft_Windows" data-test-app-aware-link="">Microsoft Windows</a> source code branch. By extension, it can also refer to the team that works on this branch. </p>
<p> Microsoft has used multiple prefixes to refer to feature branches over time:</p>  
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/microsoft-public-symbols">Setting up a Public Symbol Server</a>
<pre>You can use the Symchk tool to check to see if the Symbol file is public or private.</pre>
<h3> Release branch prefixes </h3>
<pre>Mono is acedemic .NET Framework</pre><p><a href="https://www.mono-project.com/docs/compiling-mono/windows/">Here are the Windows Build Instructions.</a></p>
<p> Similarly to the previous system, the main branch is forked off before release to contain update development. The following is the list of known prefixes:</p>
<p>You might want to install the Longhorn Driver Kit or LDK and SDK the Samples from the SDK or in the PDC 2003 Whideby DVD and the SDK Help. Here is a link to the <a href="https://archive.org/details/pdc-2003-conference-dvds-presentation-and-longhorn-discs">2003 PDC</a>and <a href="https://archive.org/details/vsenard1">PDC 2003 Whideby DVD</a></p>
<p>In the LDK Samples you might want to start a GIT Repo in the OS directory. Per kind of the Offical Windows Repo here:<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/releases?page=9">Microsoft.UI.Xaml v2.1.190405004.2</a>in the Windows Porting Directory and here: You need a login.</p>
<pre>git clone https://microsoft.visualstudio.com/os/_git/os </pre>
<p>On Windows 10 you might was to install Scalar</p>
<a href="https://vfsforgit.org/">VFS for Git: Git at Enterprise Scale</a>
<pre>Download the Windows API Code Pack extract it.</pre>
<a href="https://sphinxlogic-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/jonathanmoore_sphinxlogic_onmicrosoft_com/Eveh4s4tiyNKgN3C4JiP1HABPzMgjMH0R59f0OSkvDJszQ?e=ZNuu2Q">Download it from my Sharepoint drive</a>
<p>You can read about the Windows API Code Pack from the Code Project <a target="_self" href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/109403/Windows-API-Code-Pack-v-Released" data-test-app-aware-link="">here</a></p>
<pre>Please refactor with Visual Studio 2017, 2019 on 10 or 2005 in the XP VM,
the namespace 'Microsoft.WindowsAPICodePack' to 'Microsoft.Windows'</pre>
<pre>Set up a Lab03_N a buffer lab with a "N' NOT A FINAL LAB. with the 7 IDW SDK, IDW DDK, .NET Framework 3.5 Reference Source, 
Symbols and Classic Samples. And it wont be a Final lab until we get more source from the KGB in Russia.</pre> 
<pre>Or Install the 2008 SDK and WDK copy the 6.1 and sdk files to a Lab03_n and take note the the 7 samples directory is really your 'NT' 
directory</pre>
<pre>and compare both sdk and wdk with directories with windiff and carefully go through the samples and src directories and 
compare and recreate Lab03 save both setenv.bat files and name the apporiate files setenv.sdk and setenv.ddk.</pre>
<pre>After your done and you set the ddk environment. You can set up the VS Directory with SharpDevelop,  
The Common Compiler Infustructure, Dafney, .NET Framework 3.0 Reference Source,Symbols Windows API Code Pack, 
The Visual Studio Project System and Spec#.</pre>
<pre>Set up a Lab03_N with the Longhorn LDK, SDK, Longhorn Samples, and the MSDN Library Samples. and Classic Samples.
	Use Visual Studio 2008 	MSDN Library Samples to begin a 'Source' Layout. 
	For Future Git Version Control. Join USEINIX,and the ACM and try and 
	find Vista Microsoft Research Papers.</pre>
